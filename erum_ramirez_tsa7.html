            <h2>About VALORANT</h2>
            <p>VALORANT refers to the fictional universe that the game is set in, the histories of its characters and
                settings, and the stories/narratives that occur within. Each agent in the game has their own backstory,
                all united together under the VALORANT organizations that the game takes its name from. The primary
                narrative follows the perspective of the VALORANT Protocol agents of Alpha Earth.</p>
