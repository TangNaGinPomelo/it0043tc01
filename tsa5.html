          <p>"Red-Haired" Shanks, commonly known as just "Red Hair", is the chief of the Red Hair Pirates and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World. Having sailed with the legendary Roger Pirates since he was an infant, Shanks would begin his pirate career on their ship as an apprentice alongside Buggy, before forming his own crew following Roger's death.</p>
          <p>Twelve years ago, while operating in the East Blue, Shanks inspired the young village boy, Monkey D. Luffy to go on his own pirate journey, thus being responsible for the boy becoming the notorious outlaw he is today. He accidentally provided Luffy with the Gomu Gomu no Mi to eat, and even sacrificed his left arm to save the boy from being eaten by the Lord of the Coast out at sea. Most notably, he also owned the straw hat that once belonged to Gol D. Roger himself and has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday.</p>

          <img src="Marshall_D._Teach_Portrait.webp" alt="Character 2">
          <p>Marshall D. Teach, most commonly referred to by his epithet "Blackbeard", is the captain-turned-admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates, and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World. He is also the only known person in history to wield the powers of two Devil Fruits, as well as being part of a special bloodline, which is only known to a small number of individuals, including his own crew and the Five Elders.</p>

        <div class="character three">
            <img src="Monkey_D._Luffy_Portrait.webp" alt="Character 3">
            <p>Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat", is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</p>
            <p>Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a carrier of the mysterious "D" legacy. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Revolutionary officer Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.</p>

          <div class="character four">
            <img src="Buggy_Portrait.webp" alt="Character 4">
            <p>Buggy the Star Clown is the captain of the Buggy Pirates and co-leader of the Buggy and Alvida Alliance. Formerly an apprentice of the Roger Pirates alongside Shanks, he was one of the earliest enemies of Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates, whose actions eventually entangled him in the Summit War of Marineford. Inadvertently, the war grew his reputation enough to become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, whereupon he founded the pirate mercenary organization Buggy's Delivery. After the Warlord system was abolished, he recreated it as the Cross Guild in partnership with fellow ex-Warlords Dracule Mihawk and Crocodile.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="character five">
            <img src="Kaidou_Portrait.webp" alt="Character 5">
            <p>Kaidou of the Beasts, renowned as the world's "Strongest Creature", is the Governor-General of the Beasts Pirates and was formerly one of the Four Emperors that ruled over the New World. He is also the father of Yamato.</p>
            <p>Once a promising child soldier at the service of the Vodka Kingdom decades ago, Kaidou was drafted against his will by the Marines but managed to escape and start a career in piracy. He was invited by Edward Newgate to join the legendary Rocks Pirates as an apprentice, where he met and befriended Charlotte Linlin. During the God Valley Incident when the Rocks Pirates met their downfall, Linlin provided Kaidou with the rare Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu. He then went on to form his own crew and build it up into a powerful military force determined to challenge the World Government.</p>
